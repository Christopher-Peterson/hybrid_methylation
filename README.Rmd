# The Hybrid Methylation

(At some point, I'll put a real introduction here)

## Setup

This project uses Lonestar6 on TACC; I will be assuming you have access to the system.

1. From `$SCRATCH`, clone this repository.  You may need to setup a Github Personal Access Token to do that on TACC.

```{bash, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
cds
git clone https://github.com/Christopher-Peterson/hybrid_methylation.git
```

2. Setup and configure the [Docker/Singularity images](docker/).

## Whole Genome Bisulfide Sequence Data

1. Prepare the Data

2. [Align the trimmed reads and extract the methylation information](alignment_experiments/).
