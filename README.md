# The Hybrid Methylation Project

(At some point, Iâ€™ll put a real introduction here)

## Setup

This project uses Lonestar6 on TACC; I will be assuming you have access
to the system.

1.  From `$SCRATCH`, clone this repository. You may need to setup a
    Github Personal Access Token to do that on TACC.

``` bash
cds
git clone https://github.com/Christopher-Peterson/hybrid_methylation.git
```

2.  Setup and configure the [Docker/Singularity images](docker/).

## Whole Genome Bisulfide Sequence Data

1.  [Prepare the Data](wgbs_setup/).

2.  [Align the trimmed reads and extract the methylation
    information](alignment_experiments/).

3.  (I am working on this part)
